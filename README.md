- 👋 Hi, I'm Nick Bono, a novice in the data field who has recently started self-learning data science. I'm passionate about leveraging data to drive business insights and inform decision-making, and I'm excited to explore the field of data science further.
- 👀 As a beginner, I'm interested in exploring a few key areas within data science and machine learning, including Natural Language Processing, Time Series Analysis, Deep Learning, and Data Visualization.
- 🌱 Currently, I'm focused on building a strong foundation in Python for data science, statistics, and SQL. I understand that these are essential skills for any data scientist and I'm committed to gaining a solid understanding of them before tackling more complex projects.
- 💞️ While I'm still new to the field, I'm eager to collaborate with others on projects involving Natural Language Processing, Time Series Analysis, Deep Learning, and Data Visualization. I bring some experience in Python, statistics, and SQL, and I'm always looking for opportunities to learn and improve.
- 📫  If you have any recommendations or advice, please feel free to reach out to me via email at dbono180@gmail.com or on Twitter at @nick_bono14. You can also find me on Kaggle at @nickbono.
